Cricket Match System is a browser-based tool to manage live cricket scores. It tracks runs, wickets, balls, overs, dot balls, and extras like wides. Users can select the batting team, start/end matches, and view a history table of completed matches. Data is saved locally with a modern, responsive UI.
